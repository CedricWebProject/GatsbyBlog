**Intro | F# | F# | A | G | x2 |**

**Verse | F# | F# | A | G | x4 || G | x2 |**

It used to be everything but now we’re falling apart.\
I’m not that sensible, I’m not good for your heart.\
And I’m like: Let it go! Let it go! No, we’re not that far.\
It used to be everything but now we’re falling apart.

**Chorus |  F# | A | H | F# | x2 |**

I don’t care for you,\
You don’t know but it’s true.\
I don’t care for you, it’s true.

**Verse | Am7 | F7 | x4**

It used to be anything but damn this is so hard.\
You are so sensible, I’m not good for your heart.\
And I fucked it, I fucked it up. No, we can’t be apart.\
It used to be anything but damn this is so hard.

**Chorus |  F# | A | H | F# | x2 || xX |**

I don’t care for you,\
You don’t know but it’s true.\
I don’t care for you, it’s true.

**Verse | Am7 | F7 | x4**

It feels like nothing, baby, just right the start.\
This is not sensible, I know you are a good heart.\
And You’re like: Stop it now! Stop it now! No, this is not smart.\
It feels like nothing, baby, just let it start.

**Chorus |  F# | A | H | F# | x2 |**

I don’t care for you,\
You don’t know but it’s true.\
I don’t care for you, it’s true.

Uh, Uh, it’s true.\
Uh, Uh, it’s true.
